## Project Overview
This project implements a B-tree based index file management system. It handles the creation, insertion, searching, loading, and extraction of key-value pairs into an index file stored on disk. The B-tree structure helps manage the data efficiently by maintaining sorted keys and performing node splitting when necessary to balance the tree.

## Files in the Project

1. **main.py**  
   The main program file that contains the implementation of the B-tree data structure, including the following key operations:

2. **README.md**  
   Overview of the project and instructions for running the program

3. **devlog.md**
    The devlog with all the entries from the entire project
